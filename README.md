# 272-ExtraAssignment

This is a data analysis project using sparkR and R language.
The code was written in console, hence the committed files are highlights of the code necessary for complete execution.

Process:
1. Install Apache Spark
2. Install R
3. Open the spark downloaded folder and run sparkR in /bin
4. Once you see a message like spark session available as spark you are good to go.
5. Run the above commands(below the final implementation comment) and it should work fine.
6. The results should generate plots/graphs based on the queries written with spark.
